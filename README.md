**WrapPac** is a lightweight desktop companion for **Arch Linux** users who mix packages from the official repositories, the AUR, and Flatpak.
It unifies all installed packages into a single overview and provides convenient tools to inspect, update, or remove them ‚Äî without relying on internal pacman libraries or background root daemons.

---

## üí° Motivation

**WrapPac** was built for users who want a graphical interface that behaves *exactly like the terminal* ‚Äî using the same commands they run daily: `pacman`, `yay`, `paru`, and `flatpak`.

Most graphical package managers access pacman's functionality through the `libalpm` library, which provides programmatic control over transactions. While this approach works well for many users, some prefer the transparency and predictability of direct CLI invocation.

WrapPac takes a different approach: it's a pure wrapper around existing command-line tools, with no abstraction layers. Every action you perform in WrapPac is identical to typing the command yourself ‚Äî you see the same output, the same prompts, and the same behavior.

---

## üß† Philosophy

WrapPac is **not** meant to replace your terminal workflow ‚Äî it complements it.
It's for users who value Arch's simplicity and control, but still want a clear overview of installed packages and updates.

> **No root daemons. No hidden abstractions. No "magic".**  
> Just your real system commands ‚Äî visualized.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Philosophy

| Aspect            | Traditional GUI Package Managers       | **WrapPac**                                                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend           | `libalpm` library (programmatic API)   | Direct CLI invocation (`pacman`, `yay`, `paru`, `flatpak`)        |
| Transaction logic | Library-level transaction handling     | Identical to manual terminal commands                             |
| Privilege model   | Varies (some use persistent daemons)   | No persistent root access ‚Äî uses `sudo`/`doas` only when needed   |
| Output visibility | GUI-formatted, abstracted messages     | Raw PTY terminal showing live, unfiltered command output          |
| Update checks     | Integrated background services         | Manual checks triggered from the main window |
| Configuration     | Managed through application settings   | Uses system `pacman.conf` and all configured hooks                |

**Runtime dependencies:**

* Python ‚â• 3.10
* [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)
* `pacman` and `pacman-contrib` (for `checkupdates`)

**Optional integrations:**

* `yay` or `paru` ‚Äî for AUR support
* `flatpak` ‚Äî for Flatpak management
* `sudo` or `opendoas` ‚Äî for privilege escalation
* `reflector` ‚Äî to refresh mirrors

All dependencies are handled through the PKGBUILD.
